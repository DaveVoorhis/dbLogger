### dbLogger - Log to a SQL Database

dbLogger is a simple logging layer that logs to a SQL database rather
than the usual text-based log files.

If you haven't used logs in a SQL database, you don't know what 
you've been missing!

Logs in a SQL database can be filtered, queried, summarised,
and analysed _much_ faster and easier than text-file logs.

By default, dbLogger is designed to log to SQLite databases. 
For log viewing and analysis, you may want to use something
like DB Browser. See https://sqlitebrowser.org
